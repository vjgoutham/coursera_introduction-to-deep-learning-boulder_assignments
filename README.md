The jupyter notebook contains Convolution Neural Networks that can identify metastatic tissue in histopathologic scans of lymph node sections. The notebook was created as part of CU Boulders course on Deep Learning and aims to statisfy the work required for Week 3: CNN Cancer Detection Kaggle Mini-Project. Both instrucation for the assignment and the data can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection/overview.

If you want to try out the models, you should download the data from the Kaggle link an place the two csv-files (train_labels.csv and sample_submission.csv) in the same folder as the notebook. The folder with the test and train images should also be placed in the same folder as the notebook (that is, the folder, not the images).
